Did you know? Fashion and its supply chain is the third largest polluting industry, after food and construction. It emitted 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than shipping and aviation industry combined, as reported by Earth.org. To tackle this problem, [**Data Science**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) has emerged as a solution to help the industry reduce, reuse, and recycle.

Data Scientists are now suggesting insights related to shapes, sizes, colours, trends based upon analyzing and understanding customer behavior. This for example, increases customer satisfaction and reduces the quantity of returns a customer makes upon shopping, something that seems to be a leading cause of fashion pollution.

But avoiding fashion waste as a solution towards sustainable fashion goals is just the tip of the iceberg, there's more. Here's a quick read to find out five ways how Data Science is transforming the industry.

## 1.**Fashion Waste and Pollution**

The use of data analysis paves a way for not just reducing but in efficient reuse and recycling of fashion wear as well. Sentiment analysis used with the help of emojis, reactions or product reviews leads to identifying more suited products for the customer – a problem that often exists during the 'reuse' cycle. This helps in better redistribution and also reduces the quantity of product available for reuse in the first place.

[**Fashion Industry**](https://www.britannica.com/art/fashion-industry) also plays an important role in forecasting trends using data from social media primarily. While this largely plays out towards new designs, often designers can find repetitive patterns or recycle raw material to meet the demand efficiently, with the use of Data Science.

## 2.**Shopping Behavior Of Customers**

Data Science uses AI and machine learning to understand and analyze customer behavior which not only helps them to increase turnover but also make shopping a smooth process for their customers. For example fashion houses record comments, reviews and emojis which helps the machine understand the feedback which can generate insights for brands to use. This is especially true in case of emojis which are used in sentiment analysis, which especially helps to understand what makes the customers tick.

An understanding of the changing customer behavior helps to explore the softer side or the intangible aspects of customers, instead of focusing on just the hard facts such as sales and objectives. This goes a long way in suggesting choices based on past shopping history, and understanding more about the customer preferences without invading their privacy or asking unnecessary questions.

## 3.**Increase In Sales**

Imagine going to the mall as against online when you go shopping for your friend's wedding, buying clothes for your new job, getting in the right mindset for a vacation – while it is clear that you can save time by purchasing online, you can obviously save money as well.

With Data Science, you can now choose clothes related to the line of fashion that you actually wear, separated from a clutter of the market that you see in malls, or even online. This helps customers and merchants alike to get straight down to business, be shown clothes that are only relevant to their requirements. This is especially making it easier for merchants to show appropriate products without wasting time on identifying customer likes and dislikes as well.

## 4.**Accurate Prediction Of Trends**

Every year, or every season, fashion designers work out the finer details of the trend to be, and this is often a crucial time for them to turnaround. With the use of social media pictures, stories, now fashion houses can learn about the underlying expectations set by the consumers in advance. This leads to setting the ideation in the right direction, one that is set by market standards, and not just by the traditionally limited choices present with the designer.

This projection can be done on the basis of age group, demographics, hashtag clustering, style, taste, usage, others. Using advanced filters, it can be possible to accurately predict the shelf life or product cycle for the designs as well. Interesting? Now, last but not the least..

## 5.**Personalised Fashion**

Do you remember the time when 3D printing came up with the idea to create fashion accessories like shoes that are made to fit the size of a customer exactly? Well, now the time is here to personalize fashion for customers even more. This time, data scientists are using copious amounts of consumer data and managing the brand by understanding their target audience individually and also much better than traditional methods.
