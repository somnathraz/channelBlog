Constantly in the hunt for a top-notch best [**data science course in Bangalore**](https://skillslash.com/data-science-course-in-bangalore/)? I&#39;ll assume a &quot;Yes&quot; since you have stumbled on this blog. But, I promise you, your search for the best **data science courses in Bangalore** ends here.

In today&#39;s blog, I&#39;ll discuss the [**best data science course**](https://skillslash.com/data-science-course-in-delhi/) **in Bangalore with placement guarantee**. Before that, I&#39;ll briefly explain what data science is and who is a data science professional.

From the domain point of view, it is an amalgamation of various disciplines such as Mathematics, Statistics, Computer and Information Science, AI, and ML. In simple terms, the job of leveraging scientific methods, algorithms, and processes to interpret massive data sets and bring forth valuable insights across domains is called data science.

And the professionals who carry out these job roles and responsibilities are termed data science professionals or **data scientists**. Now, most of you might have stumbled upon the term &quot;data analyst&quot; and might wonder what the difference between them and a data scientist is. A **data analyst** usually analyzes the data and provides you with the readings or explanations based on the analysis. But on the other hand, a data scientist explains the present state through data analysis and provides future predictions through their study and algorithms.

## **Why Data Science?**

The essence of data science has become widespread for manifold reasons. First, data that existed in the past (a long time back) were in a structured format and small size. Therefore, to process it by leveraging traditional systems was not daunting. However, as years passed, these data transformed into semi-structured and unstructured formats.

[Data science](https://skillslash.medium.com/how-to-make-a-successful-and-smooth-career-transition-from-marketing-to-data-science-b8a713b8e9bd) is the only viable option to process such large and complex data, and hence, at present, you see an overwhelming demand for data scientists.

The above illustration shows only the number of jobs posted on a job portal (a whopping 10.5K+ jobs). Just imagine the actual demand for these professionals.

Now, after understanding data science, its importance, and the unstoppable demand for data science professionals, let&#39;s get to the course details and highlights (basically, what you&#39;ve come here for).

Let&#39;s start with the belief that your search for best **data science courses in Bangalore** ends here, and you are spared the trauma of frustration and wasted time.
