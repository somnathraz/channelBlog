### Points to read and remember

Andrew McAfee, author and research scientist at MIT once said "The world is one big data problem." The statement stands the test of time. Data is everywhere. Whatever industry it be - automobile, healthcare, software - you name it. Every day, people play and work with an abundance of data. It is the management and analysis of these bulk data followed by its meaningful interpretations that drive business decisions.

**Data Science** is a field which combines scientific methods, programming, analytics and statistics so as to draw meaningful interpretations from noisy data. In this blog, we will be discussing at length the potential of Data Science in a fast evolving field of civil engineering and construction.

So, if you are somebody with an academic background in civil engineering, looking to switch into a Data Science domain - this is for you! Also, learn how you can use data science skills to advance in the field of construction management and technology.

### Potential use cases of Data Science in construction

Professionals in the built environment sector these days - especially construction managers, engineers and architects who would like to advance their career with data analytics and data science, are upskilling by joining Data Science courses online. By getting trained in core Data Science concepts such as Data visualization can help construction professionals a great deal. For example, in visualizing data from buildings, applying fundamentals of machine learning to building data, analyzing features such as thermal comfort in buildings etc.

Let us have a look at some of the important applications of Data Science in the field of civil engineering -

1. **Construction engineering management**

From the planning stage to the execution stage, in erection and operation phases there will be huge computational requirements. Prediction of possible cases that can affect the building process is an important finding in itself. For example, by analyzing and forecasting reasonable data, if one can find a possible probability for building element failure during erection, several mishaps and structural/non-structural failures can be avoided.

2. **Risk analysis and rectification**

With real-time predictive analytics that uses advanced data analytics concepts, risks can be identified and mitigated on time. Identifying which element will be affected, possible reasons and consequences of failure, can help constructional professionals plan and execute building standards effectively. Not just limited to planning and analysis, analytics can help a great deal when it comes to monitoring and response to risks.

3. **Rapid mechanization**

Another term to denote mechanization would be automation. The huge umbrella of automation in construction accommodates smart robots and AI-driven tools that makes construction processes easier. Autonomous machines and tools make the process of construction easier and more accurate. Improvement in construction safety, leaving less room for laborious work, improvement in work quality, reduction in work lag and increase in overall productivity - mechanization helps it all!

4. **Design and process optimization**

With the advent of AI, construction managers can now plan and prioritize tasks in the building process and allocate enough resources to complete them on time. The risks in the job site can be identified and processes optimized. The factors of 'time' and 'money' have huge significance in the context of construction projects. Project cost should not be overrun and there should not be any delay in task completion. These two vital factors can be strictly monitored by implementing AI techniques.

Now that you are aware of the key applications of Data Science in Civil engineering, I hope the answer to 'Why Data Science' is clear. Now let us get onto answering the 'How' part of it -**How can a civil engineering professional make a transition into the Data Science domain?**

### Career switch into Data Science

Can a Civil engineer work as a data scientist or What exactly is required to make a career switch from civil engineering to data science? Come, let us explore!

The answer to the question of whether it is possible to make a career transition is yes. It is very much possible to make a career switch from civil engineering to Data Science. The key areas to concentrate when making this switch is getting a grasp of analytics, programming, statistics and math. As an engineer, the latter part of having mathematics skill would not be a concern for you.

1. Give importance to learning probability, statistics and calculus.
2. Get an understanding of programming languages such as Python. Having an understanding of technologies such as PowerBI and SQL (Structured Query Language).
3. Learn the core concepts of Machine Learning. Get a solid understanding of machine learning algorithms such as Linear regression, logistic regression etc.
4. Get a knack of data analytics and data visualization tools and concepts. Having good logical and analytical skills can undoubtedly help.
5. Do not get less weightage to improving your soft skills.Work on your communication skills, critical thinking and storytelling skills.
6. Further, it's important to get into a network and connect with people in the Data Science field. Attend meetups and conferences and educate yourself.
7. Try to get into internships and work out projects that can give you real-work experience in the data science field. Further, this can give your portfolio a competitive advantage when appearing for competitive interviews.
8. Signing up for a professional data science course can help you a great deal in helping master core concepts.
